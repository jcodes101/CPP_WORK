TIME COMPLEXITY: O(d * (n + k))

Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits. It works best for integers and is efficient for large datasets with small digit ranges.

How it works:
1. Find the maximum number to determine the number of digits (d).
2. Sort the array by each digit, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.
3. Use a stable sorting algorithm (like counting sort) for each digit position.
4. Repeat the process for all digit positions.

Key points:
- Radix sort does not compare elements directly.
- It is stable and works well for sorting numbers with a fixed number of digits.
- The time complexity depends on the number of digits (d), the number of elements (n), and the range of digits (k).
- Radix sort is not suitable for general-purpose sorting of arbitrary data types.

Example:
Array: [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]
- Sort by units digit: [170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]
- Sort by tens digit: [802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90]
- Sort by hundreds digit: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]

After all digit positions are processed, the array is sorted.

Radix sort is efficient for large lists of numbers, especially when the range of digits is not too large.
